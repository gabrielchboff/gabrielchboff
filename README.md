# Hi there! I'm Gabriel ðŸ‘‹

Hi! Iâ€™m Gabriel and Iâ€™m looking to grow up my career and increase my skills. Iâ€™m currently working as a back-end developer in an internship. I have 3 years of work experience and 5 years of studying development. I learned to be patient and share the knowledge that I have with others. Also, from logic, insights, and pragmatism, I know that I am creating something new using these skills that I mentioned. During my career I experienced a lot of opportunities to learn, working for startups and great companies.
